					<h1>Ōki-sa (大きさ)</h1>
					<p>Ōki-sa (大きさ) Dimension is a manga / anime serie which is about the 10 divisions. Like Bleach but more focused on the divisions and how the military responds to threats. Season one is most about the "five" in the military and how them work against poor threats and then a big threat are analyzed and the police forces are interrupting. After you have seen the series, you will have seen all the lieutenants and probably captains fought the evil angels and demons from the other dimensions!</p>
					<p>Hope you enjoy the story!</p>
					<h2>Divisions:</h2>
					<p>Stair 1:</p>
					<p>It is the highest level, only one captain is within this stair. It is this captain who keeps everything under control, but he can't keep track of everything at the same time, he needs the other captains under him who has one division each to control under.</p>
					<p>Stair 2:</p>
					<p>There are only four captains in this step. It's the most importent duty they have and thats to keep track on the four parts, "law, defense, information and keeping everything in peace".</p>
					<p>Stair 3:</p>
					<p>It is in this stair the captains within the military have their duty! The military is thus placed in five different duty, the strongest within physical, intelligence and power, medic, police forces "execute" and the duty under the captain of information "torture" those that retrieve information or arrive at different difficulties then the police are busy.</p>
					<h2>Monsters:</h2>
					<p>What are monsters you ask? You think the "after dead" you are going to heaven? or hell? No, this is more complicated, in every dimension there are a void, a dimension about time and space. All the souls from every creature gathering in this place, waiting to be destined for something new, like to a pregnant body, yes, to a new life! But how monster comes to, I'll tell you, it's like cancer, an incorrect move from the void and it's become a creature with a physical appearance with no intelligence about it's alive, it's just destroy and eating like a virus, become stronger for every hour, and that's why they must be destroyed fast!</p>
					<p>They are divided into 5 levels, nothing about how long they lived to do, but what level of threats they are, if they only threaten farmers, small villages, or can destroy a whole city!</p>
					<p>Level 1 are creatures that usually only cause trouble in farms or in small villages, the captains only send out the military to put an end to the misery.</p>
					<p>Level 2 is usually bigger and more dangerous, can cause a lot of trouble within villages or when you send carts to sell to different villages! The best military force is always fighting this threat!</p>
					<p>Level 3 is big enough to destroy a whole village, no, a whole city! They have no intelligence more than trying to destroy everything in their path! Captains usually send out FBI agents or lieutenants to stop this threat, but can also be a captain himself who stops the threat!</p>
					<p>Level 4 Don't Need to be bigger, but they are intelligent and have a power to create illusions inside weak people's mind! They can have a zanpakuto, but no knowledge of using it more than killing with! Captains can have a hard time knowing who to send out, usually they are about situations and what they have to deal with!</p>
					<p>Level 5 is like the virus got so much time to study humans, and created a new body of it's own! It has different powers and a zanpakuto with a similar force like everyone else's zanpakuto! Make it more dangerous than any other threat! But they do not have to be powerful, in more than 100 years it has never come as powerful as the 5 on S04! Just look at S01 so you understand! And yes, they first 5 enemies is a level five monster! Same with the threats of Level 4, Captains sending out about the situation and what kind of threats they face!</p>
					<h2>Zanpakuto:</h2>
					<p>It's a weapon that has been created from an angel or demon's spirit! Can also be a spirit of a kind of element that is made of angels or demons!</p>
					<p>The angels from S02 are fallen angels with a zanpakuto from their ancestors! But those of these angels come from another dimension thanks to their leaders who have the power to open portals to other dimensions!</p>
					<p>A zanpakuto is not included in birth, but is intended for those who join the military, but it is not all of them who get the knowledge to use this zanpakuto they get! Not the captains who choose it, but zanpakuton themselves, or their own minds that are not strong enough to handle the power or just understand it.</p>
					<h2>Force:</h2>
					<p>The force is not the power they've got, but it's all around. It's this power they use magnetic technique to bend their blades, or when they use a powerful force as a physical burst as a wind! It's kind of the basic of magic and can be said to be like just ordinary energy (Chi).</p>
					<p>It's not like Tsuyo that also is force in japanese, but in this word (Tsuyo) is a name of the category the students is learning at the academy that Yui, the Lieutenant during the 1st Division and Misty, the Lieutenant during the 7th Division are teachers in.</p>
					<h2>Tsuyo:</h2>
					<p>The power Tsuyo Is divided into three different categories, Ten'notsukai, Tenma and Shinzui!</p>
					<p>Ten'notsukai, also called power of heaven, is a category for battle support and the same power the healer is using. Can also create powerfull barrage or shields from destructive spells like Tenma!</p>
					<p>Tenma, also called power of the demons, is a category for direct attacks, everything about destruction and hurting!</p>
					<p>Shinzui, also called the power of spirit, is a category for seal their targets from doing something. It's the hardest to use, but the most powerful in combat!</p>
