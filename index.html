					<h1>Ōki-sa (大きさ)</h1>
					<p>Ōki-sa (大きさ) Dimension is a manga / anime serie which is about the 10 divisions. Like Bleach but more focused on the divisions and how the military responds to threats. Season one is most about the "five" in the military and how them work against poor threats and then a big threat are analyzed and the police forces are interrupting. After you have seen the series, you will have seen all the lieutenants and probably captains fought the evil angels and demons from the other dimensions!</p>
					<p>Hope you enjoy the story!</p>
					<h2>Divisions:</h2>
					<p>Stair 1:</p>
					<p>It is the highest level, only one captain is within this stair. It is this captain who keeps everything under control, but he can't keep track of everything at the same time, he needs the other captains under him who has one division each to control under.</p>
					<p>Stair 2:</p>
					<p>There are only four captains in this step. It's the most importent duty they have and thats to keep track on the four parts, "law, defense, information and keeping everything in peace".</p>
					<p>Stair 3:</p>
					<p>It is in this stair the captains within the military have their duty! The military is thus placed in five different duty, the strongest within physical, intelligence and power, medic, police forces "execute" and the duty under the captain of information "torture" those that retrieve information or arrive at different difficulties then the police are busy.</p>
